Before taking this class, I thought that history becoming digitized was a good thing and it had many benefits such as better archiving and more displays for historical pieces that are often left in storage. This is the thinking of many others as well. The truth is that the original piece becomes distorted and begins to have its own history separate from that which it came. An example of this is my own attempt at digitizing a statue of Saint Thomas Aquinas that I found at the University of Ottawa.
