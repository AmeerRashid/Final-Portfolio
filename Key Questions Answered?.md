Before taking this class, I thought that history becoming digitized was a good thing and it had many benefits such as better archiving and more displays for historical pieces that are often left in storage. This is the thinking of many others as well. The truth is that the original piece becomes distorted and begins to have its own history separate from that which it came. An example of this is my own attempt at digitizing a statue of Saint Thomas Aquinas that I found at the University of Ottawa. https://skfb.ly/6wsDH

The statue is much different than the original and I cannot claim that this is a digitization of the real thing because it has become its own piece. The material is not the same, the texture has changed, and the statue itself is incomplete. Without the right context, no one would know who the statue is meant to represent. And even then, that process is flawed because I could get that information wrong. 

The 3D model is then thrown out onto the open web where anyone can take the model and change it however they please. Some people even combined models in Module 2 by using other digitizations or, like me, they used the data to create music. 
The history of the object is moved further and distorted from the original.
