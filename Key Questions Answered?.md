Before taking this class, I thought that history becoming digitized was a good thing and it had many benefits such as better archiving and more displays for historical pieces that are often left in storage. This is the thinking of many others as well. The truth is that the original piece becomes distorted and begins to have its own history separate from that which it came. An example of this is my own attempt at digitizing a statue of Saint Thomas Aquinas that I found at the University of Ottawa. https://skfb.ly/6wsDH

The statue is much different than the original and I cannot claim that this is a digitization of the real thing because it has become its own piece. The material is not the same, the texture has changed, and the statue itself is incomplete. Without the right context, no one would know who the statue is meant to represent. And even then, that process is flawed because I could get that information wrong. 

The 3D model is then thrown out onto the open web where anyone can take the model and change it however they please. Some people even combined models in Module 2 by using other digitizations or, like me, they used the data to create music. https://soundcloud.com/user-617379895-776848245/thomas-aquinas-anthem
The history of the object is moved further and distorted from the original. 

Dr. Kamash discusses this in her article about the Palmyra Arch that was 3D printed after its destruction due to the conflict in the Middle East. Most people did not care much for the details because they believed that the arch would be printed exactly how the original looked, but that was not the case. Letters were written to complain about the inaccuracy of the arch and the insensitivity of the people involved (Kamash, 2017). It was meant to be a preservation of history, but that is impossible to achieve when the original is tampered with to suit the needs of the people that claim they wish to reconstruct the historical inheritance of others. 

Digital history is not the digitization of 'real life' history. It is the creation of history. I just figured this out as I type it. Critical making is what we have been doing all semester. We have taken something that we deemed important and we chose to make it into something else. That historical object is not being affected in any way, but our creations begin their own lives. With each module we stray further from the original, but it is still from the same model that we used in our first module. We are simply adding to its life as a piece of history. History cannot be reconstructed, but it can be used to create new things that will have their own stories to tell. Our modules are just a timeline of the history of one object. My mind is blown right now.
